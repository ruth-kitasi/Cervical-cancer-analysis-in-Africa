## Objectives of the analysis.

1. Identify causes of cervical cancer in Africa.

2. Highlighting the significance of cervical cancer awareness.

3.  Determine geographical variation in incidences, mortality, and prevalence.

4. Identify regions with a higher prevalence of cervical cancer.

5. Prevention and initiative strategies.

## Terms definition

- Cervical cancer incidence . This refers to the number of times cervical cancer occurs.

- Cervical cancer mortality. This refers to the number of deaths occurring from cervical cancer.

- Cervical cancer prevalence. This refers to the total number of individuals diagnosed with cancer who are alive at a specific point in time.

- Age-standardized rates (ASR) are rates used to compare cancer occurrences or mortality rates between populations with different age structures.
- Cumulative risk. This refers to the probability of developing cancer over a specified period or during a lifetime.

## Source of data for my analysis

For this analysis, I have obtained the data from the World Cancer Research Fund International, on the link attached below https://www.wcrf.org/cancer-trends/cervical-cancer-statistics/.

The website offers a worldwide overview of cervical cancer, leading to the need to filter the information specifically for Africa to align with my analysis.

To meet my other objectives, this is where I perform an ETL process from the identified website to answer questions on occurrences, mortality, and prevalence.

## Data cleaning and modeling tools.

For this analysis, I will use both Microsoft Excel and Power Query to clean and model my data. I have created five different Excel workbooks to normalize the creation of relationships in the model view. Below is a snippet of each table on the power query

- Table 1: Cervical cancer incidence table

- Table 2: Cervical cancer Mortality table

- Table 4: Cervical Cancer region table

# Creating relationships between the datasets.

To normalize the data for more standard analysis, it is important to assign each table a primary key as shown in the above tables, and link them using either a one-to-one or one-to-many type of relationship as shown below.

# Observation.

Through my analysis of cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates in Africa, it has become evident that Eswatini, followed closely by Malawi and Zambia, faces a significant burden of this disease. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions and healthcare strategies to address the challenges posed by cervical cancer in these countries.
